This module will finds the nth largest prime number using Wilson's Theorem and Converse. Which states that a natural
number n is prime if and only if (n-1)! â‰¡ -1 (mod n).

Given the nature of factorials the time it takes to find larger primes increases very quickly. However, it does work
and is very reliable.
